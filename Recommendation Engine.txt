I started by loading the user preferences data into a Pandas DataFrame and converting the categorical variables (Website, Product, Category) into dummy variables. Then, we calculate the similarity between the items, which gives us a measure of how similar each item is to every other item.

Next, I defined a function "recommend_items" that takes a user ID, the Item Similarity, and the DataFrame as parameters, and returns a list of the top 5 recommended websites or products for the user. The function calculates the average similarity for the items that the user likes, sorts the items by similarity, and returns the top 5.

Finally, I used the example usage section to demonstrate how to call the function "recommend_items" for a particular user ID and display the recommended items.
